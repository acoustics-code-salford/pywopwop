**--->>> THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT <<<---**


This package aims to provide an easier interface to interact with PSU-WOPWOP input files, mainly geometry patch files and functional loading files. A Python framework is provided to facilitate reading existing files, interacting and inspecting the data using a Python console, and creating PSU-WOPWOP input files from Python data.

## Dependencies:
* numpy: array processing for numbers, strings, records, and objects;

All dependencies are already included in the Anaconda Python Distribution, a free and open source distribution of Python. A recent Anaconda distribution (with Python 3.8.11) is used to develop and test pywopwop, and is recommended for using pywopwop.

An optional dependency for 3D visualizations of surface meshes is [pyvista](https://www.pyvista.org/), which can also be used to generate normal vectors from surface meshes. Instructions for installing `pyvista` within Anaconda can be found [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyvista).
